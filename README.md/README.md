# Balanced Engineering

A systems-inspired portfolio that models an engineer as a multi-layered architecture.
Built using semantic HTML and modern CSS, the project visualizes engineering, research,
leadership, academics, achievements, and balance as interacting layers of a system.

This repository currently implements Level-1 using only HTML and CSS.
